        <p>we are not talking about the prime times 300,000 years ago where humans would gather
            around and make groups to hunt and make farms. they used to rely on each other to 
            survive and find ways to live. even back then, there were telltale signs of humans
            slowly integrating the new untold system of "divisions". this divisions exists both
            for good and bad. ultimately, we do not inherently know nor understand what is good
            and what is bad. what we do know however, is that this divination will slowly be a
            human trait. a human trait to cast away some people from groups and so on. it has been
            researched from psychologists and alike that long time ago, neurodivergent people arent
            treated equally. they are often casted aside, and those circle of neurodivergent people
            will also go on and make smaller groups- and so on, and so forth, until theres little to
            no peope left in that group. this is why antisocial people exist. Fundamentally, people
            long time ago has normalized this system of division and exile. lets go back a step,
            because, there were also neurodivergent people who would divide other neurodivergent people
            from their own circles. it is a human thing, from our ancestors, to cut off people that we
            generally dislike and do not "conform" or "fit with". by this era, we have birthed and nurtured
            lonely men and women. these lonely men and women are the byproduct of divisions. a tool 
            that most humans have used against each other. it is questionable and debatable wether 
            us humans are considered social creatures, when our ancestors have prove to be using this
            sorts of tools until today. more people from these ages have less and less (even none)
            friends at all. the popular people, or what the social people might call them celebrities,
            or whatever, are generally surrounded by people- either friends or fans, or even family.
            however, there has been a rise to parasocial relatinships as well. we are not immune to
            our human traits to divide and exile. in conclusion, SOME humans are not DEFINED as social
            creatures.
